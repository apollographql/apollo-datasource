# @apollo/datasource

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#1](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-datasource/pull/1) [`698cd7a`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-datasource/commit/698cd7ab6e04b102854c6170be2b19afa2c47e6e) Thanks [@trevor-scheer](https://github.com/trevor-scheer)! - Rename package to `@apollo/datasource`. The transition to this package should be seamless, as there are no changes to the interface. Where you once used `apollo-datasource`, you would uninstall and replace that with `@apollo/datasource` instead.
